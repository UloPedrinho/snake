      - hot/red faster
      - cold/blue slower
  - [ ] grow/decrease
    - [ ] how to grow ? how many squares?
    - [ ] drecease (?) how many squares?
  - [ ] change direction
  - [ ] break 
    - "superpower" which can break tail, walls...

*** TODO Game class
*** STARTED Board class
    - [ ] unmark_cell is useful ??
*** STARTED Snake class
    - use a 'deque' for snake's body.
    - how the body grow: 
      - snake grows by the head in the event direction
      - when grows there's not movement
      - when eat some special type of food the body must grow by one cell (or maybe more.. food...).
      - when grow by eaten some special type of food:
        - the tail not move from the last point.
        - the current head point is added to the snake body, and so the body not move
          - if grow more than 1 cell.. the body not move until 'growing' property be equal a 0
    - [ ] use this or directly call vector size/begin/end methods ?
      #+begin_src c++
        int size;
        Point start_pos;
        Point end_pos;
        deque body
      #+end_src
    - [X] Is the tail or the head which grow ? the head!!!
    - [X] use 'deque' better than 'vector'
      - better performance in insert and remove operations; O(1)
    - [ ] control limits board when grow
    - [ ] 'generate' method actions: 
      - [ ] control growing/decreasing state.
      - [ ] advance every body Point when not growing/decreasing(?)
*** TODO food
    - [ ] when put food?
*** TODO villians
** TODO comments in files and classes
